Krautrock is probably the first time you've heard the name. Let's not talk about why it's called that, but let's talk about how I came across it.

   My introduction to Pickle Rock actually came from reading the JOJO8 manga. One of the characters in the manga was named Tian Most Ring, and his alternate name was Vitamin C. After checking it out out of curiosity at the time (because I knew Araki was a music fan so there had to be a corresponding source), I found out that the name was derived from the title of a song by the band Can, and that's how I got my first listen to Can's music.

   I was completely mesmerized by Can's psychedelic, avant-garde and experimental music, which I felt was tailor-made for me and listened to 800 times a day. I listened to all of Can's albums over and over again and went crazy listening to over 300 albums by different kimchi rock bands.

Now it's time to talk about why it's so "weird" to call it kimchi rock. It was invented in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the German experimental rock movement, which emphasized improvisation, psychedelic atmospheres, and experimentation. Known as Krautrock in the British press, this style of music initially had a somewhat playful tone, but later became widely accepted and popular. "Krautrock" can be interpreted as "Kraut rock". In fact, it can also be interpreted as a kind of experimental music with a psychedelic flavor, because I often listen to it like I'm high (bushi).

Regarding the history of kimchi rock, it is important to mention that West Germany around 1968 was in a period of post-war cultural reconstruction and reflection. The younger generation was eager to break free from the constraints of tradition, and music became an important channel for them to express themselves and explore their inner world. Pickle Rock profoundly influenced later electronic music, avant-garde rock, post-punk and even modern indie music.

   by the way ,recommend a d-song site I really like --> https://www.progarchives.com I have a big part of my rock music discovered on it.
