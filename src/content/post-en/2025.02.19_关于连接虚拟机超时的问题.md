Today, when using MobaXterm to connect to a virtual machine, I got a Network error: Connection timed out, which surprised me, because yesterday I was able to connect to it, but today I suddenly can not. After checking, I found that the ip of the NAT mode I am using has not been changed!

You can see that the virtual NIC I'm using here is VMnet8
