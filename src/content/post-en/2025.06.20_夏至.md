在一片哗然的时候

Then I know the silence of the night.

My childhood was with weasels on summer nights.

Moonlight through the culvert

It's a river gentler than a veil

Curled up on a bamboo mat that I fell asleep on as a child.

The green is algae, the red is mosquitoes.

Mulberry leaves touching silkworms during the day

Nightly Contact Gratitude

The hemp tiger gulps down the real panic of a small child.

Carrying a kerosene lamp to find the light of a firefly.

It's getting late. The river stops flowing.

Grandfather in the rice paddies with a golden back

Tamping up a hoeful of fragrant mud

I woke up a grown man.

The asphalt is frying my paws.

A torrential downpour sends the terraces tumbling

I wiggle my tail fin more than I shave a fish's scales.

At the end of the highway time to walk again

The secret of summer is hidden by the rocks in the gutter.

Spring plowing and sowing, mango summer and hope

Death is warm and peaceful.
