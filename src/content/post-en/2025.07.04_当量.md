人们的看法太直接，

When you see the woods, you turn up the grave soil in search of roots.

But the woods are wooded bones.

Maybe it's from the dinosaurs, maybe it's from our ancestors.

Triassic reptiles didn't have coffins.

But our grandparents have.

If you're not a human being, you don't have a funeral.

No mourning, no tears.

Bluestar has no tear ducts.

How can we have a river that runs on?

The river is a mirror.

Dinosaurs would look in the mirror and stare, too.

But the mirror is controlled by the heart.

Music awakens the soul.

Maybe it will awaken the souls of the dinosaurs as well.

If we're going to rebuild Jurassic Park.

Dinosaurs should have their stomachs removed first, leaving their hearts behind.

If they are not driven by the heart.

It's the only way to get a second life.

Scientists can't accurately measure that.

atria, ventricles and meteorites.

How many equivalents of explosives, respectively.
