No more summer weather

Collar up, neck down.

Walking by the river

Strange Ducks

Submarine operators

Ripples, curved reflections.

dark

When the wind blows, the reeds float coldly.

I'm afraid to go too far.

I'm afraid that the rain will trap me.

Like the wind trapping the clouds

A cloud traps the rain.

I'm walking by the river.

A man absorbing the silence of the river

Nobody knows.

My body flows

Its entire vein
