Since I got on my motorcycle.

I just want to throw something away.

It's raining in every direction.

I don't like heights.

Keeping things sober doesn't work.

---

Nylon raincoats are useless to me.

Now I'm a half-slug.

What's the difference between that and a snail, you ask?

I can't get my neck into my chest.

The original didn't work.

---

I want to throw something away.

Like throwing a stone.

From the ground to the sky

Something clever is controlling me.

It doesn't help to throw something away.
