- Sometimes I just burst out laughing.

  I don't know why.

  When you don't think about it.

  On the contrary, it's quite normal.

- What happens when I pee on a flower?

  I ask myself this question.

  Until I realized

  I'm asking myself questions.

- It irritates me.

  Like a sudden leg cramp.

  It hurts like nothing else.

- You know.

  Are you a plant's genitals yourself?

  If you know

  It becomes human.

- Why me?

  To worry about this...

- Sometimes I wonder.

  It's too many gullies in the brain.

  It's the problem that's spinning in there.

  Like water that can't find its way out.

- When I see the flowers

  I should have thought of flowers.

  It's for the eyes.

- If the flowers have enough time

  And enough quiet.

  Does it work from

  In the reflection of my eyes

  Recognize yourself.

- in any case

  Hana doesn't want anything.

  I can't feel it.

  live by oneself
