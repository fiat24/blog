雨从后半夜开始下

The night is scattered with water vapor.

In summer, all sentimentality disappears

In the flower garden, there are bird-shaped people

Going to capture the only chance for transit.

Raindrops are thoughts that flash through the air

When the wind picks up, they form a handful

Dead narcissus pruned in the closet.

Please screw my life dry.

So that the lotus blossoms can wither and prosper with the rain

Infiltrate lignified bones.
