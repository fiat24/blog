- Optimized for an afternoon with roocode+gemini2.5preview, changed the original spinning CD to disco light globes and added a dark mode.
- It was actually a sudden thought of Polar Disco that inspired this. With the original music of "Extreme Disco", I think it goes well together.
- Overall I'm happy with it, I don't know if I'm in the mood to optimize it later.
