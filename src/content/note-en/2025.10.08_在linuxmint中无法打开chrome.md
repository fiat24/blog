Recently changed the daily system to LinuxMint, in the use of chrome browser found that can not be opened, after a network search and some practice, found that it is caused by chrome's lock file. The solution is:

End all chrome processes

```

killall chrome

```

Remove lock file

```

rm -f ~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock

```

Then you can open it normally.

----------------------------

Probable Cause:

Not closing chrome correctly, the process is not fully terminated, so the lock file still exists in the configuration file, making chrome think that the process is not finished.
