Open https://bgp.tools/
Enter your VPS IP, enter
Then click on the DNS tab and select Show Forward DNS.
There are a bunch of domains in the same network segment for you to choose from, then pick a few domains, click on them, and then use your browser's developer tools to see if they are TLS 1.3 and X25519 certificates.
The advantage is: the same network segment, the site is cold enough, the delay is within 1ms to steal the certificate speed.
