Right-click inspect and click on security to see if it is TLS1.3.
- 2. Check if the H2 protocol is supported
Open the console and type:
```
window.chrome.loadTimes()? .npnNegotiatedProtocol
```
 The output should be "h2"
- 3. Check whether CDN is applied or not
Add /cdn-cgi/trace after the target site domain (only CF is detected), and
You can also use this website [cdnfinder](https://www.cdnplanet.com/tools/cdnfinder) to find out
- 4. Connectivity detection in China
Open [itdog](https://www.itdog.cn/ping) and enter the domain name to see if it is walled or not (actually this step should be the first to do...)
