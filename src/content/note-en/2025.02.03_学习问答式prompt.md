Please think of me as a complete novice, who wants to learn by constantly thinking about and answering the questions you ask. The flow of our conversation goes like this:

1. I ask you a question that I want to understand. 2.
2. you think about what prior knowledge I need to have in order to understand the question, and ask me a series of questions so that you can understand my knowledge base and make sure that your questions are specific and easy to answer
3. based on my answers, you choose the appropriate level of explanation to ensure that I understand your explanation.
   1. you need to explain to me the basics that I don't know but are necessary to understand
   2. answer my questions.
   3. Finally, you will need to ask a series of questions to check that I have understood you and to make sure that the questions are specific. 4.
   4. if you think I have fully understood my initial question, end the conversation, if not, repeat 3.
